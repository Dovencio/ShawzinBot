# ShawzinBot
Convert a MIDI input to a series of key presses for the Shawzin. Any MIDI input works with this script (a MIDI keyboard, a virtual MIDI channel, etc)

## Usage
There's two ways you can use this script. Either download the binary from the releases, or install AutoHotkey and run the script from there (make sure you download all 3 scripts!)
Once the script is running you can choose the MIDI input to use. To do simply right click the icon in the tray and use the submenu.

Once in game you MUST change your Shawzin to the chromatic scale, as this is the one used by default. Failure to do so will result in your song sounding wrong.
If you see your song is not playing the correct notes, or something went wrong simply stop the MIDI input, change your Shawzin back to the chromatic scale and press numberpad 0.

## Tips & Tricks
You can play MIDI files by using a program like Aria Maestosa (https://ariamaestosa.github.io/ariamaestosa/docs/index.html) paired with LoopBe1 (https://nerds.de/en/loopbe1.html)
Note that multiple notes played at the same time often sound wrong though.
